    "title": "Kashmir: Paradise on Earth",
    "full_text": "Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir, unfolds like a dream where the Dal Lake mirrors the snow-capped Pir Panjal mountains. A shikara ride at dawn reveals a floating world—vendors selling saffron and flowers glide past houseboats carved with intricate cedar patterns, their reflections dancing on the water. The Mughal Gardens, Nishat and Shalimar, stand as testaments to an emperor’s love for nature, their terraced lawns and fountains framed by chinar trees ablaze in autumn hues. Beyond the lake, the old city whispers history through the wooden arches of Jama Masjid and the bustling lanes of Lal Chowk, where the aroma of wazwan—Kashmir’s multi-course feast—wafts from local eateries. A day trip to Gulmarg, just 50 kilometers away, transforms the scene into a winter wonderland, where the world’s second-highest gondola ride lifts you above pine forests to Apharwat Peak’s snowy expanse. Here, skiers carve paths through fresh powder, and the silence of the Himalayas feels eternal. Returning to Srinagar, the evening aarti at Shankaracharya Temple atop a hill offers a panoramic view of the valley, the city lights twinkling like stars against the darkening sky. Kashmir’s beauty isn’t just in its landscapes—it’s in the warmth of its people, the resilience of its culture, and the stories etched into every corner of this paradise on Earth.",
